# 💤 Sleep-disorder-finder-application

Welcome to the **Sleep-disorder-finder-application**! This project leverages machine learning and web technologies to help identify potential sleep disorders from user input data.

---

## 📝 Introduction

Sleep disorders affect millions globally, impacting health and quality of life. **Sleep-disorder-finder-application** is designed as a user-friendly tool to assist users in identifying potential sleep-related issues. With a robust backend powered by Flask and machine learning, it can analyze relevant data to provide actionable insights.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Machine Learning Prediction**: Uses trained models to predict sleep disorders based on user data.
- **RESTful API Backend**: Built with Flask for easy integration and scalability.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)**: Enables secure API communication from multiple platforms.
- **Easy Deployment**: Simple configuration and setup for local or cloud environments.
- **Extensible**: Modular code structure to add more features and improve prediction accuracy.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `pip` package manager

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Sleep-disorder-finder-application.git
   cd Sleep-disorder-finder-application
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the backend**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python app.py
   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. **Start the Flask backend**  
   By running `python app.py`, the backend server will start on the default port (usually `5000`).

2. **Interact with the API**  
   - Send user data via POST requests to the backend endpoint (details to be defined in the API documentation).
   - Receive predictions about possible sleep disorders.

3. **Integrate with a frontend**  
   - Use CORS-enabled endpoints to connect your web or mobile UI.

> **Note:** Example API usage and endpoints will be available in future updates.
